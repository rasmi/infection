# Infection Visualization
## Usage

Click a node to run [`limited_infection`](https://github.com/rasmi/infection/blob/gh-pages/visualization.js#L109-L128), double-click any node to run [`total_infection`](https://github.com/rasmi/infection/blob/gh-pages/visualization.js#L99-L106). Drag the slider to adjust the infection rate for `limited_infection`.
This visualization was built using [d3](http://d3js.org).
